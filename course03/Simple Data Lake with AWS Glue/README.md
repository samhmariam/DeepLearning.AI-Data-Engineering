# Simple Data Lake with AWS Glue

In this lab, you will use AWS Glue to transform some raw data files into useful data sources. A simple data lake with S3 will be used as a storage solution, and for the data retrieval you'll use Glue Crawler alongside Athena. You will explore some good practices related to the storage and partitioning of data sources.
