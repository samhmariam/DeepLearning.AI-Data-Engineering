# Building a Data Lakehouse with AWS Lake Formation and Apache Iceberg

In this lab, you will create a Data Lakehouse with a medallion architecture using AWS Lake Formation, Apache Iceberg tables, MySQL on Amazon RDS, and a streaming service storing data in Amazon S3. You will use AWS Glue jobs to populate the architecture, query the data with Amazon Athena, and configure everything using Terraform.
