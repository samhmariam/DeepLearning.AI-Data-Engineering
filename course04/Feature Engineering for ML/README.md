# Feature Engineering for Machine Learning


In this lab, you gained practical experience in feature engineering for both numerical and categorical data, a vital step in the ML process.

You will start with numerical data, focusing on standardization. By using tools like StandardScaler from scikit-learn, you will learn how to standardize numerical features to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. This transformation is crucial for many ML algorithms that are sensitive to the scale of input data.

Next, you will addressed categorical data by transforming it into a format suitable for ML models. Using techniques like one-hot encoding, you will convert categorical variables into binary vectors. This method allows ML algorithms, which typically require numerical input, to effectively utilize categorical data. One-hot encoding ensures that no ordinal relationship is implied among the categories, preserving the integrity of the categorical data.

Finally, you will combine the standardized numerical data and the encoded categorical data into a unified dataset.
