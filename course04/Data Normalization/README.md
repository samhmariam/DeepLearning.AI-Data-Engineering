# Data Normalization



In this lab, you will transform a One Big Table (OBT) into First Normal Form (1NF), Second Normal Form (2NF), and Third Normal Form (3NF). This process of normalization is crucial in designing efficient and reliable databases.

Throughout the lab, you will explore the importance of each normal form and the specific steps required to achieve them:

- 1NF: Ensuring that each table cell contains only atomic (indivisible) values and each record is unique.
- 2NF: Building on 1NF by removing partial dependencies, ensuring that non-key attributes are fully dependent on the 
       composite primary key.
- 3NF: Further refining the table structure by removing transitive dependencies, ensuring that non-key attributes are 
       dependent only on the primary key.
