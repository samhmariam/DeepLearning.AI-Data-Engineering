# Capture Data Change with Flink and Debezium

In this lab, you will implement a streaming pipeline with the intention of capturing data changes from a source system and delivering those changes in real time to a target system. 

In this lab, you explored the implementation of Change Data Capture (CDC) using Apache Flink and Debezium. The combination of Debezium and Flink offers a powerful solution for capturing and processing data changes, making it easier to maintain consistency and derive insights from continuously evolving datasets.
