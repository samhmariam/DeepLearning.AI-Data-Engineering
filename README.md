# DeepLearning.AI Data Engineering Specialization

This repository contains notes, code, and hands-on projects for the [DeepLearning.AI Data Engineering Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/data-engineering) specialization on Coursera.

## Overview

The specialization is designed to teach the foundational skills and modern tools required for data engineering. It is ideal for aspiring data engineers, data scientists, and software engineers seeking to build scalable data pipelines and production-ready data systems.

The repo contains:
- **Jupyter Notebooks:** Interactive lessons, assignments, and demonstrations (main language: Python)  
- **Python Scripts:** Supporting code for data processing and pipeline automation  
- **HCL and Shell Scripts:** Infrastructure as code (IaC), orchestration, and pipeline operation scripts

## Specialization Courses

1. **Introduction to Data Engineering**
   - Data engineering principles, data lifecycle, and programming paradigms
   - Introduction to Google Colab, Python, and TensorFlow

2. **Source Systems, Data Ingestion, and Pipelines**
   - Working with various data source systems (databases, APIs, files)
   - Batch and streaming data ingestion techniques
   - DataOps fundamentals: testing, monitoring, automation
   - Orchestration tools & workflow automation with tools like Apache Airflow

3. **Data Storage and Queries**
   - Data storage systems: relational databases, NoSQL, data lakes, and warehouses
   - Data partitioning, indexing, and optimization for large-scale storage
   - Querying with SQL and other tools

4. **Data Modeling, Transformation, and Serving**
   - Data modeling and schema design
   - ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) and ELT processes
   - Data transformation techniques
   - Serving data for analytics and machine learning applications
