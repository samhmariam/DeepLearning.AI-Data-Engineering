## Source Systems, Data Ingestion, and Pipelines

In this course, we will explore various types of source systems, learn how they generate and update data, and troubleshoot common issues you might encounter when trying to connect to these systems in the real world. You’ll dive into the details of common ingestion patterns and implement batch and streaming pipelines. You’ll automate and orchestrate your data pipelines using infrastructure as code and pipelines as code tools. You’ll also explore AWS and open source tools for monitoring your data systems and data quality.
