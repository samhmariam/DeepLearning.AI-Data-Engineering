# Testing Data Quality with Great Expectations

In this lab, you will work on generating some expectations and validations over a dataset in a PostgreSQL Database. For that, you will also interact with the different components of GX: 

    - Data Context, 
    - Data Sources,
    - Expectations and suites, and
    - Checkpoints.
