# Part 1 - ETL and Data Modeling

In Part 1 of the capstone project, you will develop an ETL data pipeline for DeFtunes, a music streaming company, to handle their new digital song purchase feature. The pipeline will prepare and serve data to the data analytics team for analysis.  The pipeline will follow a medallion architecture, storing data in an S3 bucket, transforming it using Iceberg tables, and modeling it into a star schema in Redshift using dbt.
