# Data Quality, Orchestration, and Visualization

In Part 2 of the capstone project, you will enhance the data pipeline you built in part 1 by integrating data quality checks, orchestration, and data visualization to create a more robust architecture. This includes developing analytical views to showcase insights generated by the pipeline. In the process, you will refine your skills by practicing with key Data Engineering tools.
